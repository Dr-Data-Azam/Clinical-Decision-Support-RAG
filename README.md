Enterprise-Ready Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for Heart Failure
This project demonstrates a production-ready, AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System designed to bridge the gap between complex medical guidelines and point-of-care decision-making. By leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline, the system provides clinicians with instant, evidence-based answers from the 2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure.

The architecture is designed for enterprise use, featuring a decoupled frontend and backend, containerized for portability, and deployed on a scalable cloud platform (Microsoft Azure).

üöÄ Live Cloud Deployment
The full application is deployed on Microsoft Azure Container Apps.

Live Backend API Docs: https://cds-backend-app.ambitiouscliff-0211bfd7.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io/docs

‚ú® Core Features & Business Value
This system is more than a technical demo; it's a blueprint for a real-world clinical tool.

Reduces Clinical Workload: Automates the time-consuming process of searching through dense medical documents, allowing physicians to get answers in seconds.

Improves Quality of Care: Promotes adherence to the latest evidence-based guidelines, ensuring consistent and high-quality patient care.

Seamless EHR Integration: Utilizes the CDS Hooks industry standard to push context-aware recommendations directly into the physician's workflow, requiring no extra clicks or context switching.

Understands Patient Context: Consumes and processes patient data in the FHIR format to provide relevant, patient-specific guidance.

Application Interfaces
1. EHR-Integrated CDS Card: A recommendation card appears directly in the EHR when a relevant patient's chart is opened.

2. Interactive Chatbot: A full-featured chatbot, built with Streamlit, allows for deep-dive questions and follow-up conversations.

üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Architecture & Deployment
The system is built using a modern, scalable, multi-service architecture.
