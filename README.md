# Enterprise-Ready Clinical Decision Support System (CDSS) for Heart Failure

This project demonstrates a production-ready, AI-powered Clinical Decision Support System designed to bridge the gap between complex medical guidelines and point-of-care decision-making.  
By leveraging a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, the system provides clinicians with instant, evidence-based answers from the **2022 AHA/ACC/HFSA Guideline for the Management of Heart Failure**.

The architecture is designed for **enterprise use**, featuring a decoupled frontend and backend, containerized for portability, and deployed on a scalable cloud platform (**Microsoft Azure**).

## üéØ Core Features & Business Value

This system is more than a technical demo; it's a **blueprint for a real-world clinical tool**.

- **Reduces Clinical Workload**: Automates the time-consuming process of searching through dense medical documents, allowing physicians to get answers in seconds.  
- **Improves Quality of Care**: Promotes adherence to the latest evidence-based guidelines, ensuring consistent and high-quality patient care.  
- **Seamless EHR Integration**: Utilizes the CDS Hooks industry standard to push context-aware recommendations directly into the physician's workflow, requiring no extra clicks or context switching.  
- **Understands Patient Context**: Consumes and processes patient data in the **FHIR** format to provide relevant, patient-specific guidance.

## üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Architecture & Deployment

The system is built using a **modern, scalable, multi-service architecture**.

- **Containerization**: Both the **FastAPI backend** and **Streamlit frontend** are containerized with Docker, ensuring consistency across development and production environments.  
- **Cloud Deployment**: The application is deployed on **Microsoft Azure Container Apps**, a serverless platform that provides automatic scaling, HTTPS, and managed infrastructure.  
- **CI/CD Ready**: Images are versioned and stored on Docker Hub, enabling automated build and deployment pipelines.
